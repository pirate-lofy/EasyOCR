Training notes:
  1. preprocessing -> resizing, normalization, optional padding, optional
     contrast manuplation

  2. uses CTCLoss which is prefered in time-series data, like text recognotion
  3. CTCLoss solves the problem of characters taking multiple time-steps
  4. it uses BidirectionalLSTM
  5. it doesn't use transformation
  6. vgg -> bilstm -> CTCLoss
